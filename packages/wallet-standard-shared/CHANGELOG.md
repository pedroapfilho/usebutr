## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- 302ae4a: Fix Wallet Standard connections failing with "Failed to get account"

  Discovery mapped each wallet into a plain copy, which read `accounts` once, before connect, and pinned the empty list. Every `getAccount()` after a successful `standard:connect` then resolved to `null` and the connection was rejected. The wrapper now reads `accounts` and `chains` through to the wallet.

  The same copy minted a new object per event, so `unregister` no longer matched the wallet seen at `register` and a removed extension never tore its pool entry down. Wrappers are now memoised per wallet. Feature objects are also passed through rather than spread, keeping their methods bound to the wallet.

  Affects every Wallet Standard platform: `@usebutr/svm`, `@usebutr/sui`, `@usebutr/bitcoin` and `@usebutr/polkadot`.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 9b1caa2: Correctness pass across the storage, hydration and connector layers. Several of
  these change observable behaviour; the ones worth knowing about before upgrading:

  **Breaking**

  - `SuiWallet.signTransaction` now returns `{ bytes, signature }` instead of
    `Uint8Array`. Sui's `executeTransactionBlock` needs both, and each connector
    previously returned a different half, so the old value could not be broadcast
    and a consumer could not tell which half they held. SVM and Bitcoin keep their
    single-`Uint8Array` shape.
  - `@usebutr/svm`'s `sendTx` returns the signature base58-encoded, matching the
    WalletConnect namespace, the Ledger app, Solana explorers and
    `getSignatureStatuses`. It previously returned base64.
  - `@usebutr/sui`'s feature input types drop the `string` arm from
    `transaction`; wallets only ever accepted the `toJSON()` form. Strings and BCS
    bytes are now wrapped for you, so `sendTx` accepts strictly more than before.

  **Behaviour fixes**

  - `WalletStorage.setPool` and `removePoolEntry` could self-deadlock on a corrupt
    pool payload, leaving `connectWallet` unresolved and every later pool write
    jammed for the page's life. Both are fixed, and `readWalletSnapshot` now shares
    one codec with `WalletStorage` so the server and client decodes cannot drift.
  - A seeded (SSR) entry whose silent reconnect failed used to stay in the pool
    backed by a placeholder connector forever, so `useSigner`/`useBalance`
    reported an error and `useConnectionStatus` reported `"reconnecting"`
    permanently. Those entries are now dropped.
  - `useSigner` and `useBalance` stay `idle` for a wallet that is still
    reconnecting instead of surfacing a placeholder rejection as `status: "error"`.
  - `useConnectionStatus` lets a live `"connecting"`/`"error"` take precedence over
    the derived `"reconnecting"`, so an in-flight attempt and a connection error
    are no longer hidden. New `useIsReconnecting(connectorId?)` answers the
    per-wallet question directly.
  - A background restore no longer writes the connect-attempt status or steals
    `activeConnectorId`, and a superseded `CONNECT_FAILED` no longer overwrites the
    current attempt.
  - An externally-disconnected connector is now torn down, not just dropped from
    the pool, so a cached adapter is not reused while still holding a session.
  - EVM: a malformed provider response is treated as absent rather than `""`, which
    previously produced chain `eip155:0`, zero-length signatures, empty transaction
    hashes and a confident `0 ETH`. `switchChain` gained the same-chain
    short-circuit `sendTxToChain` already had.
  - WalletConnect: accounts carry their own chain instead of all being stamped with
    the active one, so a multi-chain session no longer returns a wrong-chain
    address. One pairing now covers every configured namespace, the pairing URI
    survives a reconnect, and concurrent connects share one pairing.
  - Bitcoin: the sats-connect (Xverse) adapter honours `silent`, so a reload no
    longer triggers an unsolicited approval prompt, and exposes the payment address
    as its single account instead of also presenting the ordinals address as
    spendable.
  - Polkadot: the injected adapter actually delivers events to subscribers,
    `switchChain` notifies like its Wallet Standard sibling, and chain resolution
    prefers the mainnets rather than whatever the wallet listed first.
  - Ledger: the device session is committed atomically, so a locked device no
    longer leaves an open transport that reports itself connected, and concurrent
    connects open one transport.
  - SVM: `sendTxToChain` submits to the chain you asked for instead of the
    adapter's current one, and rejects a chain the wallet does not advertise.
  - `@usebutr/svm`'s `switchChain` capability now counts only `solana:` chains, so
    a multi-namespace wallet no longer advertises a method that always throws.

  **Testing**

  - `createFakePersistence` is now the real `WalletStorage` over memory drivers
    rather than a parallel implementation, so it inherits upsert semantics,
    validation and JSON round-tripping. Two divergences are fixed as a result:
    `setPool` upserts rather than replaces, and `clearAll` leaves the
    user-disconnected flag alone.
  - `createFakeConnectedWallet` rejects being given both an `adapter` and explicit
    `addresses`/`accounts`, a combination whose halves could disagree.

### Minor Changes

- 7887cf0: Export `buildWalletCapabilities`, the Wallet Standard capability mapping that `@usebutr/svm`, `@usebutr/sui`, `@usebutr/bitcoin` and `@usebutr/polkadot` each re-implemented. It takes a flat feature profile and owns the flags that are constant across every namespace, so only the feature-name mapping stays per-package.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- efe4550: Share the session plumbing behind the Wallet Standard and WalletConnect CAIP adapters. `@usebutr/wallet-standard-shared` now exports `createWalletStandardCore`, which the Bitcoin, Polkadot, Sui and SVM adapters build on; the WalletConnect Bitcoin, Sui and SVM namespaces share an equivalent CAIP core. Every package's public API is unchanged. The one visible difference is a dev-console warning: a failed SVM disconnect now logs `[butr] SVM Wallet Standard disconnect threw:` instead of `[butr] Wallet Standard disconnect threw:`.

### Patch Changes

- 937dfae: Bump runtime dependency floors (`@wallet-standard/app` 1.1.1, `@ledgerhq/*` latest minors, `@walletconnect/universal-provider` 2.23.10) and modernize public type declarations from method signatures to property function types (oxlint `method-signature-style`). Type-level only — no runtime behavior change.

## 0.2.4

### Patch Changes

- a46eecd: Ship unminified ESM so downstream bundlers (Vite/esbuild dep pre-bundling) process the package correctly; fixes a ReferenceError in consumer dev servers. The consuming app minifies once at its own build.
- 3f26776: Warn (once) when `@wallet-standard/app` can't be loaded instead of silently disabling discovery. Wallet Standard discovery (used by the SVM, Sui, Bitcoin and Polkadot connectors) dynamically imports the optional peer dep `@wallet-standard/app`; when the import failed it was swallowed, so no wallets appeared with no hint why. It now logs a single actionable warning, forwarding the underlying error.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- b77a477: Shared Wallet Standard protocol types (`WalletStandardWallet`, `WalletStandardWalletAccount`, `WalletStandardAppModule`, `WalletsApp`, `StandardConnectFeature`, `StandardDisconnectFeature`, `StandardEventsFeature`, `StandardEventsListener`) are imported from `@usebutr/wallet-standard-shared` directly — they are no longer re-exported from `@usebutr/svm`, `@usebutr/sui`, or `@usebutr/bitcoin`. Platform-specific feature shapes still ship from their own packages.

  `@usebutr/svm` adapter ids are now platform-prefixed (`wallet-standard:svm-<slug>`), consistent with the `sui-` and `btc-` prefixes. `slugify` in `@usebutr/wallet-standard-shared` requires a non-empty platform prefix.
